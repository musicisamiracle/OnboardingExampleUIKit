# Onboarding Example using UIKit
This is a code example for creating an onboarding flow using UIKit. The architecture is based on the VIPER pattern. 

There are 3 screens. The first screen requests location permissions. The location is not actually fetched, this is just here to provide an example of using a system API that requests user permission.
